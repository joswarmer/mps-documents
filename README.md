# mps-documents
MPS Plugin enabling files of any type to be included and accesible in an MPS project

Exceptions when creating or deleting files:

- Open model TextfileExample.model.Documenten
- Go to the dots
- Press enter
- type in any filename (eg. test.txt)
- click the create button

And look in the console or the log for exceptions.

Now
- open the file (test.txt) through the open button and start typing
- say "I want to edit this file anyway"
- close the file
- delete the file using the delete button in 'Documenten"

And more exceptions appear.
